BATTLE ALERT
A Smart IoT Device for Emergency Communication in Military Attacks

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Battle Alert is an IoT-based wearable emergency communication system designed to enhance soldier safety in combat zones. 
The device automatically detects emergencies using health monitoring and also allows manual distress signaling.
It sends real-time alerts with GPS location and health status to command centers using GSM communication.
The system works even when traditional military communication fails.

KEY FEATURES
- Automatic emergency detection using heart-rate monitoring
- Manual panic button for instant alerts
- Real-time GPS tracking with Google Maps link
- SMS alerts with location, heart rate, and timestamp
- Automatic voice calls to emergency contacts
- Multi-recipient alert system
- Low power consumption (48–72 hours battery life)
- Fully autonomous operation

HARDWARE COMPONENTS
- ESP8266 / NodeMCU
- MAX30102 Heart Rate Sensor
- NEO-6M GPS Module
- SIM800L / SIM900 GSM Module
- Panic Button
- Li-ion Rechargeable Battery

SOFTWARE & TOOLS
- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 Board Package
- TinyGPS++ Library
- MAX30102 Library
- GSM AT Commands

SYSTEM WORKING
1. The device continuously monitors heart rate.
2. GPS module tracks real-time location.
3. Emergency is triggered automatically or manually.
4. GSM module sends SMS and makes voice calls.
5. Alerts reach command center and rescue teams.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
